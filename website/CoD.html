            <h2 id="codIntro">An Introduction to Call of Duty</h2>
            <p>Call of Duty is an FPS franchise owned by Activision studios which is then developed by both Treyarch and Infinity Ward. The game started small but quickly geww to be one of the largest video game titles in world. People wuickly became acompetive on the game starting with sniping clans playing competitive Search and Destroy for money piggy backing the competitve scencce of its rival game at the time halo.</p>

            <h2 id="codHistory">The History</h2>
            <p>The competive sniping community was very small however served as the basis for Call of Duty eSports. These players eventually left compting andd started to make online content with their skills coinciding with the rise of ganming on youtube. This then lead the competive community to turn to using regular wepons forming the starting grounds of todays competivive scence. Two years pass before we see brands start to form themselves gaining a fanbase like OpTic, FaZe clan and Team Envyus. As these brand were gaing more traction it drew more eyes on tto the scence with the torument websites now being able to run LAN competitions for example MLG, Gfinity, UMG. This was then the time Activision noticed the views and the attractioon to their game so they decided to make a one million dollar tornument to celebrate the release of their new game Modern Warfare 3. This was one of the first of its kind having the developers put their own money up to run a LAN event. This was then the spark for the next couple years of competitive Call of Duty. Fast forward to Adavanced Warefare the league is becoming more commercialised with noteable sponsers and being branded the MLG pro circuit because of this the contraversial no under 18s rule was annoced cutting some young players short on their journeys however was a step forward to becoming more accepted by critics. The next year activision aquired MLG and branded their own circuit as the Call of Duty World League. This was the first time activison had dedicated their oown money to an entire season of the game and the succcess of it would determine Call of Dutys future as a reputible eSport.

            <h2 id="codPresent">The Present</h2>
            <p>Today the community stands proud after just finmishing its first franchised seasoned season with 12 city based franchised teams competiting for over $6 million dollars. With all time high viewershipe peaking at 500 thousand people watching concurrently. In order to enter the franchise it cost teams $25 million. Due to this new found franchise teams and activision have been able to aquire reconisble brands for sponsership ranging from an exculsivty deal with youtube gaming to sponsers like PopEyes chicken, Mountain Dew and Zippo.
