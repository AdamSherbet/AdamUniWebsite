            <h1 id="opticTitle">The Rise, The fall and The Ribirth of the Green Wall</h1>
            <h2 id="opticRise">The Rise</h2>
            <p>OpTic Gaming. That name to so many people means so much and it is inexplictable as to why. OpTic started out as a competitive sniping clan back in World at War. They competed on torument websites where they met the referee Hector "Hecz" Rodriguez who then became close friends with the sninping clan. He was then asked to join the clan so he gave up his position as a referee. Later Hecz was given leadership of OpTic and decided in the best intrests of the clan to step away from competitive sniping and focus more on creating online content. This one then become the heart and soul of OpTic, contenent first. This then created the intial OpTic fan base from content creators such as OpTic Predators and Pamaj. This fan base was then there to cheer on OpTic at one of their first events in black ops 1. The team cossisted of Rambo, MerK, BigTymeR and ProoFy. Being the underdogs for most their carear OpTic decided to build a power house roster asfter losing advanced warefare champs with NaDeShot annoncing his retirment shortly after the loss. The new roster consisted of Scump, Karma, Crimsix and Formal. This would then become the most dominant roster in call of duty history dominating multiple seasons. This team then won the infinite warfare world champs to solidify the dynasty in calll of duty history. This was the calm before the storm. </p>
            <h2 id="opticFall">The Fall</h2>
            <p>Shortly after the Infinate Warfare win OpTic was looking for investors to help build and expand their brand and organsisation. This is where mistakes were made. Hector ended up selling to an investment group known as infinite eSports which involved neil lieberman owner of the Texas rangers. This company took over OpTic and started to expand rapidly the first mistake by the company. The rapid expension took away from what OpTic was, fans were becoming deattached from players not keeping the family unit OpTic once had. The second mistake throwing out tradition. Tradition to OpTic was everything, infite sold OpTics Halo team one week after they had won the world final, fans became angry. Infinite were also not paying the Call of Duty players purposefully causing infighting in hopes they would have an excuse to remove themselves from call of duty. Once Hector caught wind of this he became furious and tried to recover the helm of OpTic. While this was going on the once dominant call oof duty team was sufferning some massive losses even losing to a losers bracket run FaZe. To many fans OpTic was dieing. Optic was later sold and bought by Immortals gaming club. OpTic was dead the greenwall followed hector to his new home at NRG. </p>



            <h2 id="opticRebirth">The Rebirth</h2>
            <p>2020 redemption arc started for most people when a news arctical leaked that Hector had reaquired OpTic. A few weeks go by another leaked artical saying that Hector had sold the spare CDL spot to NaDeShot and he was going to create the LA Thieves. One week later The LA Thieves were announced as an official CDL team, this gave more OpTic fans hope that there team was going to return to its former Glory. One week ago the tweet was tweeted, the post was posted, It was offial. The Greenwall were back. Fans flooded twitter. Hector was back in control, OpTic were back in call of duty represtenting the city were it all began. Chicago. Tradition restored, orginall members were back the culture was back. OpTic can only return and excceed their former glory. </p>

            <p>Together we stand, Together we fall, Together we are the Greenwall </p>
